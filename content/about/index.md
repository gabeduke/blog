This site documents building an IOT monitoring fleet. The data is logged from OpenFaaS functions to Prometheus and exposed via Grafana. The original idea for this project was to notify me when the Christmas tree water level dropped, but the system is designed to fit many generic cases.

The ideal use case for this system design is to pull batch environmental data from many sources into a time series database for monitoring & alerts.
